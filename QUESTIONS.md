- ch2-02/03 and ch2-04.py produce very slightly different results even though they implement the same computation.
  These scripts all use the same input and structure, but ch2-04 uses numpy. You've tried changing dtype, and
  changing argument order to no effect. Why is there a very slight difference? Does it matter? Try to produce the
  same result in C (easier to look at disassembly).
